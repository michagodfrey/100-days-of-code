#100DaysOfCode Log - Round 3

### Day 1, 1 January 2023

**Today's Progress**: I worked on a POWR, progressive overload workout recorder, a workout app that will show the user if they have added volume to each exercise.

**Thoughts:** Learning at lot about Firebase Firestore and this project has forced me to think about data structures like I haven't needed to before.
