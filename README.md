This challenge gives me a system to practice coding. I am currently doing my second round and have set myself the following rules:

### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will push code to GitHub and/or share a screenshot on Twitter every day so that anyone can see my progress.
4. I will update the Log with the day's progress and provide a link or specify local path.
5. I will divide code challenges between the following categories:
  - My own projects
  - JavaScript practice challenges
  - Frontend Mentor challenges
  - Tutorials where necessary to learn things (although I will try to minimize these)
6. I will rotate these categories each day to keep it fresh and interesting.
7. I will encourage at least one other coder doing the challenge on Twitter everyday.

## The System

### *Every morning, after I make my coffee I will code for at least 1 hour. I will not use my phone or any social media site during this hour.*

This will ensure the minimum commitment is met. However, I will strive to do more than one hour and do a second session in the afternoon/evening.
