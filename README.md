This challenge gives me a system to practice coding. I am on my 3rd round and have set myself the following rules:

### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will push code to GitHub and/or share a screenshot on Twitter every day so that anyone can see my progress.
4. I will update the [Log](r3-log.md) with the day's progress.
5. I will divide code challenges between the following categories:
  - My own projects
  - FreeCodeCamp courses
  - CodeWars pratice exercises
6. I will encourage at least one other coder doing the challenge on Twitter everyday.
