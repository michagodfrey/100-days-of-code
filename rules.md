# Rules of the 100 Days Of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment
### *I will code for at least an hour every day for the next 100 days.*

## System
### *Every morning, after I make my coffee I will code for at least 1 hour. I will not use my phone or any social media site during this hour.*

This system ensures the minimum commitment is met. I aspire to code for more than 1 hour and also fit in a second session in the afternoon/evening. 

#### Start Date
Round 1 - December 12th, 2021.
Round 2 - May 11th 2022. (adjusted rules)

## Additional Rules
1. I will tweet about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode
2. If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
3. I will push code to GitHub and/or share a screenshot on Twitter every day so that anyone can see my progress.
4. I will update the Log with the day's progress and provide a link or specify local path.
5. I will divide code challenges between the following categories:
  - My own projects
  - JavaScript practice challenges
  - Frontend Mentor challenges
  - Tutorials where necessary to learn things
6. I will rotate these categories each day to keep it fresh and interesting.
7. I will encourage at least one other coder doing the challenge on Twitter everyday.
