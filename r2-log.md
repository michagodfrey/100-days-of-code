### Day 25: June 4, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  Started doing up and project I made for the Treehouse TechDegree.

### Day 24: June 3, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  Practiced a litte JavaScript. Watched #100Devs lecture on Express. Refactored coin-flip game to Express.

**Thoughts:** The only way to get it done is to dive into it. Also, my tweets that admit struggle or failure get a lot more traction. Not good actually.

### Day 23: June 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**:  Did a bit more on objects, some of the harder stuff. But I didn't get much else done, lots of distractions

**Thoughts:** That's the good thing about this challenged, it forces me to do the minimum.

### Day 22: June 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I started doing a CSS drawing as I didn't have much time to dedicate to coding today, but abandoned that and practiced objects in 100 days of JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** but I realized that this is a dumb(ish) to practice CSS art.

### Day 20: May 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked on making the server side coin flip but got stuck when I modified the borrowed style. Wasted a lot of time.

### Day 19: May 29, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I tried to do 100Devs homework after watching videos. I tried to follow a text tutorial but got stuck. Worked with the code a bit and made a dice flip game where the random face is generated on the server side.

**Thoughts:** #100Devs looks like a great bootcamp. I spent most of my time trying to make a cool flip animation but couldn't manage it in the time available.

### Day 18: May 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Practiced JavaScript functions, studied how JavaScript event loop works, and started a trivia flashcard app using trivia API. I will use this to practice working with APIs and add things like buttons, multiple choice, score etc

**Thoughts:** I got a lot done today

### Day 17: May 27, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I practiced loops, studied how JS works with web apis and promises and started working on the Fiji site. This needs and over haul if it's going to be on my project showcase.

**Thoughts:** The 100Devs looks like a great course with good job focussed stuff.

### Day 16: May 26, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I practised JS arrays, completing the exercises for Day 5 30 Days of JavaScript. Also watched Leon's Bootcamp video on backend.

**Thoughts:** I wanted to work on projects but I couldn't. No inpsiration. Sometimes I wonder if frontend dev is right for me.

### Day 14 -15: May 24 - 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I practised some JS and was exposed to regular expressions for the first time. Also fixed the html and accessibility and issues in the FEM challenge.

**Thoughts:** Need to practice basic stuff with JS so it becomes second nature.

### Day 13: May 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the routes to the images and submitted the to Frontend Mentor. Something I was worried would happen, happened; I used framer motion and that made the solution not display properly - Lol!

**Thoughts:** This project showed me I don't understand React well yet and need to study it as well as practice.

### Day 12: May 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I finished off and deployed React to GitHub pages and it's not displaying the images. I fixed some paths in the SCSS files and that rendered the background images but I still can't get the main content showing. Tomorrow I will try to use require with the images then changing the urls in the data.json file. If those don't work I'll try displaying all the images as background images.

**Thoughts:** Typical really. I need to learn more about React Router and deployment.

### Day 11: May 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Installed Framer Motion package and added animations to the Space project as well as final polishing.

**Thoughts:** Was happy with how intuitive Framer Motion is to use and how this

### Day 10: May 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I figured out how to do the line in the header, display the portrait image on the technology page with react-responsive, and made the nav links show active style when active. However, I had problems using the package, but resolved it. I also spent a long time barking up the wrong tree trying to use Link with useState while NavLink has a specfic isActive function as I found out today.

**Thoughts:** I worry that there will be errors down the road because of the package. I will need to learn more git commands.

### Day 9: May 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continued the Space project. Sorted an issued with view height and the sidebar.

**Thoughts:** Progress feels very slow.

### Day 8: May 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Made a hover effect with key frames that looks ok. The rest of the day was failing at the more tricky stuff.

**Thoughts:** I worry the last part will be really hard for me and will stretch for days. I think I need to review screen size basics. Started watching a vid on it and I already see I lack some basic knowledge.

### Day 7: May 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continued styling, got some more subtle styles worked out, like blur effects with backdrop-filter and box shadow to make underlines on hover and active states.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I am taking a long time with this project but I want it to be really nice so I can put it on my showcase.

### Day 6: May 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Refactored CSS into SCSS files for styling. Used mixins for the media queries for the first time. Started simplyfing the syles.

**Thoughts:** I like how the SCSS neaten the code so much. You can see how the elements are related to each other more easier and the media queries.

### Day 5: May 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: More styling and I have a lot to go. Tried to add the mobile slide menu but couldn't get it to display for some reason.

**Thoughts:** The CSS sheet is getting too unweildy. Since FEM is all about presentation, I will refactor the CSS into SASS and make it nice and logical and neat.

### Day 4: May 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Marathon CSS day stylising the Space project.

**Thoughts:** It is taking longer than I thought. CSS is so fiddly and time consuming building from the bottom up.

### Day 3: May 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Set up the fetch functions for the local data in the Space tourism site.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with the images a bit until I remembered that images must be in the public folder.

### Day 2: May 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I started the Space Frontend Mentor challenge.

**Thoughts:** I'm getting some good practice with React and React Router I think. Also how cool is it that today is R2 D2.

### Day 1: May 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I finished off a CSS art project. There are no SVGs used, only HTML elements stylised by pure CSS.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm as good at CSS as I need to be for the time being. In this round, I will focus on other things like JavaScript, React and Node.js.
