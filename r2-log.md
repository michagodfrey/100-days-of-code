# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2

### Day 10: May 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I figured out how to do the line in the header, display the portrait image on the technology page with react-responsive, and made the nav links show active style when active. However, I had problems using the package, but resolved it. I also spent a long time barking up the wrong tree trying to use Link with useState while NavLink has a specfic isActive function as I found out today.

**Thoughts:** I worry that there will be errors down the road because of the package. I will need to learn more git commands.

### Day 8: May 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Made a hover effect with key frames that looks ok. The rest of the day was failing at the more tricky stuff.

**Thoughts:** I worry the last part will be really hard for me and will stretch for days. I think I need to review screen size basics. Started watching a vid on it and I already see I lack some basic knowledge.

### Day 7: May 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continued styling, got some more subtle styles worked out, like blur effects with backdrop-filter and box shadow to make underlines on hover and active states.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I am taking a long time with this project but I want it to be really nice so I can put it on my showcase.

### Day 6: May 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Refactored CSS into SCSS files for styling. Used mixins for the media queries for the first time. Started simplyfing the syles.

**Thoughts:** I like how the SCSS neaten the code so much. You can see how the elements are related to each other more easier and the media queries.

### Day 5: May 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: More styling and I have a lot to go. Tried to add the mobile slide menu but couldn't get it to display for some reason.

**Thoughts:** The CSS sheet is getting too unweildy. Since FEM is all about presentation, I will refactor the CSS into SASS and make it nice and logical and neat.

### Day 4: May 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Marathon CSS day stylising the Space project.

**Thoughts:** It is taking longer than I thought. CSS is so fiddly and time consuming building from the bottom up.

### Day 3: May 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Set up the fetch functions for the local data in the Space tourism site.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with the images a bit until I remembered that images must be in the public folder.

### Day 2: May 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I started the Space Frontend Mentor challenge.

**Thoughts:** I'm getting some good practice with React and React Router I think. Also how cool is it that today is R2 D2.

### Day 1: May 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I finished off a CSS art project. There are no SVGs used, only HTML elements stylised by pure CSS.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm as good at CSS as I need to be for the time being. In this round, I will focus on other things like JavaScript, React and Node.js.
