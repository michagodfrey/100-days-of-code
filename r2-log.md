# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2

### Day 1: May 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I finished off a CSS art project. There are no SVGs used, only HTML elements stylised by pure CSS.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm as good at CSS as I need to be for the time being. In this round, I will focus on other things like JavaScript, React and Node.js.

### Day 2: May 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I started the Space Frontend Mentor challenge.

**Thoughts:** I'm getting some good practice with React and React Router I think. Also how cool is it that today is R2 D2.
