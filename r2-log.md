# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2

### Day 14 -15: May 24 - 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I practised JS arrays, completing the exercises for Day 5 30 Days of JavaScript. Also watched Leon's Bootcamp video on backend.

**Thoughts:** I wanted to work on projects but I couldn't. No inpsiration. Sometimes I wonder if frontend dev is right for me.

### Day 14 -15: May 24 - 25, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I practised some JS and was exposed to regular expressions for the first time. Also fixed the html and accessibility and issues in the FEM challenge.

**Thoughts:** Need to practice basic stuff with JS so it becomes second nature.

### Day 13: May 23, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the routes to the images and submitted the to Frontend Mentor. Something I was worried would happen, happened; I used framer motion and that made the solution not display properly - Lol!

**Thoughts:** This project showed me I don't understand React well yet and need to study it as well as practice.

### Day 12: May 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I finished off and deployed React to GitHub pages and it's not displaying the images. I fixed some paths in the SCSS files and that rendered the background images but I still can't get the main content showing. Tomorrow I will try to use require with the images then changing the urls in the data.json file. If those don't work I'll try displaying all the images as background images.

**Thoughts:** Typical really. I need to learn more about React Router and deployment.

### Day 11: May 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Installed Framer Motion package and added animations to the Space project as well as final polishing.

**Thoughts:** Was happy with how intuitive Framer Motion is to use and how this

### Day 10: May 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I figured out how to do the line in the header, display the portrait image on the technology page with react-responsive, and made the nav links show active style when active. However, I had problems using the package, but resolved it. I also spent a long time barking up the wrong tree trying to use Link with useState while NavLink has a specfic isActive function as I found out today.

**Thoughts:** I worry that there will be errors down the road because of the package. I will need to learn more git commands.

### Day 9: May 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continued the Space project. Sorted an issued with view height and the sidebar.

**Thoughts:** Progress feels very slow.

### Day 8: May 18, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Made a hover effect with key frames that looks ok. The rest of the day was failing at the more tricky stuff.

**Thoughts:** I worry the last part will be really hard for me and will stretch for days. I think I need to review screen size basics. Started watching a vid on it and I already see I lack some basic knowledge.

### Day 7: May 17, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Continued styling, got some more subtle styles worked out, like blur effects with backdrop-filter and box shadow to make underlines on hover and active states.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I am taking a long time with this project but I want it to be really nice so I can put it on my showcase.

### Day 6: May 16, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Refactored CSS into SCSS files for styling. Used mixins for the media queries for the first time. Started simplyfing the syles.

**Thoughts:** I like how the SCSS neaten the code so much. You can see how the elements are related to each other more easier and the media queries.

### Day 5: May 15, 2022

**Today's Progress**: More styling and I have a lot to go. Tried to add the mobile slide menu but couldn't get it to display for some reason.

**Thoughts:** The CSS sheet is getting too unweildy. Since FEM is all about presentation, I will refactor the CSS into SASS and make it nice and logical and neat.

### Day 4: May 14, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Marathon CSS day stylising the Space project.

**Thoughts:** It is taking longer than I thought. CSS is so fiddly and time consuming building from the bottom up.

### Day 3: May 13, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Set up the fetch functions for the local data in the Space tourism site.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with the images a bit until I remembered that images must be in the public folder.

### Day 2: May 12, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I started the Space Frontend Mentor challenge.

**Thoughts:** I'm getting some good practice with React and React Router I think. Also how cool is it that today is R2 D2.

### Day 1: May 11, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I finished off a CSS art project. There are no SVGs used, only HTML elements stylised by pure CSS.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I'm as good at CSS as I need to be for the time being. In this round, I will focus on other things like JavaScript, React and Node.js.
