# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 12, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Improved a gh-pages site I have made to practice JS DOM manipulation. 

**Thoughts:** It looks better now but the table is not displaying as I'd like. This problem only became apparent after I pushed the changes to Github.

### Day 2: December 13, 2021 

**Today's Progress**:I wasn't happy with the table in the chem prep chart page so I added some styling. I was planning futher steps to add more chemicals and types of treatments. 

**Thoughts:** The style for input and output is looking better and I'd like to expand this page with more chemicals. However, I think if I do it all in html and javascript it will become unwieldly with too many dom elements to manage. I am learning React right now so maybe I can apply that when I am more comfortable with that.

### Day 3: December 14, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Marginal gains in understanding the basics of React, mostly components and props. 

**Thoughts:** Felt like a grind today, and I will keep grinding until I get it. 

**Link to work:** I am using Treehouse courses on this, React track and mainly this practice https://teamtreehouse.com/library/introducing-the-practice-37

### Day 4: December 15, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: I managed to learn a little bit about React props and rendering. I gained a little more insight into how props work. 

**Thoughts:** Another slow day. I am limited by not yet understanding the fundamentals and syntax of react. The Treehouse coursework on React seems a little dated, the concepts not sticking and the challenges beyond me. 

**Link to work:** Worked on this couse a bit today, final challenge and quiz beyond my abilities for the time being https://teamtreehouse.com/library/react-components

### Day 5: December 16, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Continued my React journey, was hampered by some bad luck getting React to run. Still, some concepts are starting to sink in and a started a basic react to practice things on my own and move away from coding along with tutorials. 

**Thoughts:** Step by step.

### Day 6: December 17, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** I finished another tutorial by Web Dev Simplifed. I had an issue with React not working for a while when I tried to install a package. I installed the latest version of Node.js, unusually the version was too low to create React projects but I was doing it before. Anyway, decided to pivot from React for a bit to work on my profile page. 

**Thoughts:** My profile page is amateurish. I'm going to rebuild it with SCSS and better layout and color scheme. The next few days will focus on that and make it look like I'm serious about a job as a web developer.

### Day 7: December 18, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** I opened up project 4 from the TechDegree that I completed about 2 months ago. This project made use of SASS and made a copy of it and started building a new portfolio page that might actually look job worthy when it's finished. 

**Thoughts:** I do like the SASS as a system for organizing styling of webpages and for a uniform style. 

**Link to work:** Here is project 4, not really today's work but the basis for it. https://github.com/michagodfrey/web-style-guide

### Day 8: December 19, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the profile page. Had more difficulty with css transitions than I anticipated. I had to put that part aside for now beacuse I  was getting bogged down and didn't make as much progress as time allowed. 

**Thoughts:** It's still frustrating when elements don't behave as you'd like and

### Day 9: December 20, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Another day of slow progress despite dedicating available time before and after work. Marinal progress while I got hung up on the simplest things like elements not positioning as I intend. 

**Thoughts:** It occurred to me to use the responsive layout of project 2 in treehouse to do the projects. Tomorrow morning I know where to start. 

**Link to work:** Home/Web/project4 on my Dell Lattitude, still not worthy of public viewing, but hopefully by tomorrow the general layout will be in place.

### Day 10: December 21, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Made strides today in my understanding of flexbox and background images/images. I am now set to have slick, uniform project displays in a responsive layout. 

**Thoughts:** It's good to feel good about it all again, despite, I admit, a long time spent on what seems fairly trivial. 

**Link to work:** Home/Web/project4 on my Dell Lattitude, still not worthy of public viewing, for real tomorrow I should have something, I hope!.

### Day 11: December 23, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Implemented an email service with added contact page in the portfolio. 

**Thoughts:** Still slogging through and moving at a snails pace despite at least 5 hours today and 4 yesterday. I feel like the universe is throtlling me and wouldn't have got this far if I wasn't determined. Still just get little things that behave in ways I can work out. Having issues with SVG icons. 

**Link to work:** Home/Web/project4 on my Dell Lattitude, still not worthy of upload.

### Day 12: December 24, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Improved my contact page with emailjs, along with the general layout of the portfolio. 

**Thoughts:** Did better today, when I make tangible progress, I end the day feeling much better. 

**Link to work:** Home/Web/project4 on my Dell Lattitude, still not worthy of upload.

### Day 13: December 25, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Made strides in the presentation of the portfolio. Improved the contact page, projects, svg icons and added another Treehouse project to fill out the project list. I just need to jazz up the intro and about section then it will be ready to become my main page. 

**Thoughts:** Another good day. There were challenges but with persistence I overcame them.

### Day 14: December 26, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Made good progress and I'm almost ready to upload the portfolio as my github page. Just need to improve the fonts and decide on a color scheme. 

**Thoughts:**  My portfolio is coming along nicely and I am happy with how it looks.

### Day 15: December 27, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Finsihed the draft of the improved portfolio. Pushed to github, had to create new branch and merge it. 

**Thoughts:**  I decided on a color scheme (blue/yellow). Have some clear things to improve moving forward. I'm going to add some shadows and small improvements. Make the drop down more fluid, add a better photo of me and improve the messaging experience.

### Day 16: December 28, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Didn't have as much time today because of christmas commitments, but managed to fix a bug with the about me dropdown and fix a layout issue in mobile view. However, due to my limitations with git push, I somehow lost my changes and don't know how to locate my files that contain the up to date files. 

**Thoughts:**  By fixing the bug I learned something about selecting elements in the DOM and applying styles. It seems that when you give an element a style with javascript elementName.style.dispay = is an inline style. This has implications. Also, I somehow made my showcase folder revert to the old project and in doing so I lost the changes. This is a similar thing that happened with the treatment chart. Lucky it's backed up, I'll have to pull it and start over. I had to edit the code directly. Need to learn more about git. 

**Link to work:** Progress likely deleted.

### Day 17: December 29, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Managed to pull the online repository (it was suprisingly simple - $ git pull <url>) and this allowed me to make the minor edits to improve my portfolio. I found a way to install sass on atom, but it doesn't seem to work unfortunately. On the other hand, I can stage an commit changes through atom now. 

**Thoughts:** Yesterday's progress was not deleted. I could find it by switching back to the old branch. Improved my understanding of git. This is my journey, one problem after another rears its ugly head, and I stare it down and solve it.

### Day 18: December 30, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** I created an image gallery with photos from my mum's place in Fiji. I used baguette box to implement the photo gallery. It's a first step for what will be an actual website showing off their awesome Fiji life. 

**Thoughts:** I was please that I could adapt the Treehouse project 5 for a real world project, however basic.

### Day 19: December 31, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** More polishing of my portfolio, added box shadows, got the intro looking the way I looked and improved the contact page a little. 

**Thoughts:** I attempted to make the about section slide in and out with the show more/show less button, but I learned that display none doesn't work well with translate and opacicity/display: hidden mean the elements still take up the same amount of space. I will need something more advanced implement this feature.

### Day 20: January 1, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Only got in about an hour today, but added an embedded map with embedgooglemap.net in the Fiji page. No API needed but it took some work to make the map responsive, W3 Schools had code I could adapt for it. 
  
**Thoughts:**  The First day of a new year and I can see my habit of coding every day is forming. Even though I was tired after going to the beach this morning, I snuck in over and hour of coding work.

### Day 21: January 2, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Did up the Fiji page to something worthy of adding to my showcase. 
  
**Thoughts:**  Sometimes I still get bogged down when I try to create responsive layouts that change with media queries. That happened today, but I found that it was often one line of CSS that was screwing things up and taking a break and coming back fresh often works wonders too.

### Day 22: January 3, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I tackled (and finished in the same day!) the added feature of a loading animation and auto return to index.html when a user sends a message. The way to do a loading animation was to put a gif in the html with display set to none and set it to flex when the user hits send. 
  
**Thoughts:** I am pretty chuffed that I got it done in one sitting, I encountered problems, but figured them out. In fact, one had me baffled, but I laughed when I saw what I did. I set the location.href to the live page, github.io, instead of index.html. So after the first message I couldn't figure out why not only it stopped working, but the code had disappeared! Lol!

 ### Day 23: January 4, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Today I set up VS code to follow along with react in 10 hours tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UZrsTqkcW4&list=RDCMUC8butISFwT-Wl7EV0hUK0BQ&start_radio=1&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org. Didn't have time to build much but sometimes you just need to knuckle down. 
  
**Thoughts:** I think the React course will be slow, I will need a system to get some of my *own* code out on a daily basis for this challenge. I guess I could try building the ant app or something as I go? 

**Link to work:** VS code

### Day 24: January 5, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continuing the react full course. It was helpful revision on components, what JSX is and using CSS.
  
**Thoughts:** Not much to think about today. I just wish I had more time to dedicate to coding. The sooner I can gain some competence with React to do my own stuff the better it looks for #100 days of code.

### Day 25: January 6, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continuing the react full course. Had a few 'aha' moments with components, props and maps. 
  
**Thoughts:** I like how the course goes through every methodically and shows the rationale for why everything is done the way it is.

### Day 26: January 7, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued the react tutorial, started the advanced section and completed the useState lessons. Tomorrow I will tackle the first project, birthday something. 
  
**Thoughts:** Today I read about ageism in the tech industry, it's a little concerning and I know I'm at a disadvantage but I'm not going to let it disuade me from pursuing my objective of working in tech.

### Day 27: January 8, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Completed first project - birthday list. Continued the react tutorial and completed useEffect lessons. Couln't upload to githut and tweet because of a few noon errors I made uploading to github. 
  
**Thoughts:** The projects turned out to be a paid course on Udemy. But for a mere $25 AUD for the lot seems well worth it so I went for it. Tackling the projects helps me notice the little things that I don't when watching tutorials. While my knowledge of git and github has improved a lot, I have a long way to go.

### Day 28: January 9, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Continued turorial, didn't start projects as planned. However, I did resolve the github/git issues nicely and pushed my work remotely. 
  
**Thoughts:** Today I was tired, had distracting responsibilities and schedule was out of whack. Was a little disapointed with my progress this weekend. Despite the extra time, only accomplished as much as a weekday on both sat and sun.

### Day 29: January 10, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Some progress in the 02-Tours tutorial. I was setback by the node folders not downloading, so wasted my morning on technical difficulties. I started with an online sandbox that should be a better way of sharing my work and I won't be downloading copius files. 

**Thoughts:** Frustrated with how often I have set backs from things that I can't control. It's embarrasing how poorly I've done today.

### Day 30: January 11, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Working on React Projects and finished off 02-tours, completed 03-reviews and did most of 04 accordion. 2 and 3 were a bit beyond me and I had to look at the solution to solve them. But I have done all of 4 so far by only looking at past code examples and extraporatling. That is progress.

**Thoughts:** I think I can finish the final part of 04-accordion without checking the solution, right now all the accordion boxes open and close at once. I need to figure out how to loop through them and I think 03-reviews has clues.

### Day 31: January 12, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Added 2 photos to the Fiji webpage and finished the 04-accordion, or viewed the soltion rather after couple hours trying. 

**Thoughts:** A little disapointed I didn't figure out the more strait forward way to import the data into App. I wouldn't have had the accordian problem.

### Day 32: January 13, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Little progress on React, only ended project 4. Also noticed and issued where the SVGs were not displaying on Chrome browers this whole time. Hoever, it seems not to be showing on sadfari still. Also, I notice that on interent explorer it looks like a disaster. 

**Thoughts:** Another frustrated day, 2 in row now. Dedication and focus has been the problem if I'm honest.

### Day 34: January 14, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Started a new React tutorial, was having bad luck, code not working. In the evening, I completed my first Frontend Mentor challenge, a social media card, 

**Thoughts:** I can't keep slugging through React if I'm supposed to be completing stuff in 100 days of code. I think I should practice what I have learned, especially in CSS and JavaScript.

### Day 35: Janaury 15, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I worked on another challenge by front end mentor. Didn't quite have the time to finish it today. I'm focusing on using grid, BEM (block, element, modifier) naming convention in css, as well as addressng a few faux pax I made in yesterday's somewhat hasilty uploaded submission. 

**Thoughts:** I am humbled and impressed by the number of people who want to offer a hand in my journey to become a web developer. It was disappointing that my first front end project was poorly positioned, but everyone is so kind and helpful. I got a lot out of it.

### Day 36: January 16, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Finished the second front end mentor challenge. Ran into a strange issue with gh-pages. Worked on my profile page and linked it to my resume on Google docs. 
  
**Thoughts:** For some reason, when I pushed the FE mentor file to gh-pages, they ignored the css folder and took on the css and scss files of the main portfolio! I had to put the normalize and styles css files in the same folder and index.html and then it worked.

### Day 33: January 17, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Just plodded along, didn't have time to finish it today. 
  
**Thoughts:**  I enjoy using the javascript and keep managing to figure how to get it to do what I want. I am very happy that I am genuniely enjoying coding.

### Day 41: January 22, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Submitted challenge. Finally figured a work around for the buttons and inputs. I think the code is pretty inefficient.  
  
**Thoughts:**  It was also a shame that the dimesions were off despite my best efforts and the colors are a bit wrong for the output numbers.

**Today's Progress:** Did 07-slider in the React projects. Just coded along really as a refresher, then added a component as a little mini challenge by the instructor.

### Day 43: January 24, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Discovered react render and tried to use to create a simple webpage with links to a few pages. I couldn't get it to work. 
  
**Thoughts:**  I have a lot of set backs with React. It's annoying. I have nothing to show for today's work.

### Day 44: January 25, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Made some progress learning React. Slowing gaining confidence with it despite the setbacks. 
  
**Thoughts:**  Couldn't get routers to work today either. Slept through my alarm somehow, my routine is out a this is annoying and preventing work.

**Today's Progress:** Did more of the React tutorial and navbar project. Made a start on my first own React project - revamp of biosecurity tips, now named: ATTBA for Australian Travel & Trade Biosecurity Assistant 
  
**Thoughts:** A better day. I am feeling more confident with React, I think I will be building on it while I still feel pretty clueless about it, but I will learn.

**Today's Progress:** Continued in tutorial, looked at useReducer and useContext and how these can help in bigger projects.
  
**Thoughts:** A am gathering the pieces that I'll need for my own React project. I should be able to create a good demo.

### Day 50: January 31, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Spent it working out why Routes from react router wasn't working. I ended up installing version 5 (current V is 6) and used Switch and the links seem to be working. 
  
**Thoughts:**  Just my luck but I learned how to install earlier versions of sofware packages, and it was good practice resolving a problem.

### Day 51: February 01, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Did some work on the ATTBA project.
  
**Thoughts:** Feels weird working on my own thing after being in tutorial land for over a week. That means I was away from it too long.

### Day 52: February 02, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I was building up the ATTBA project, chose a color scheme, green and gold, built an accordian in the about section. 
  
**Thoughts:** I liked coding today. I wish I could do it faster. Also I find choosing color themes hard, and layouts. Maybe backend would be better for me.

### Day 53: February 03, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Did more work on the react project. 
  
**Thoughts:** I need to stay focused and have a clear goal, or I run the risk of derailing this project. Also, I need to be uploading more stuff soon.

### Day 55: February 05, 2022

**Today's Progress:**  Worked on displaying modals, progress was slowed because I didn't implement some necessary code and only discovered this in the evening. Still, I managed to implement a modal pop up for the each state. 
  
**Thoughts:**  Sometimes I feel like the universe throttles my progress.

### Day 56: February 06, 2022

**Today's Progress:**  I attempted to create the pests page with components displayed and links to a page with each pest. I got the starting data in but spent most of the time barking up the wrong tree, following the cocktail tutorial and doing it for an API rather than data file. Figuered out at the end how to display the pests as a list. 
  
**Thoughts:**  Today was good React immersion even if I was bumbling aroud.

### Day 57: February 07, 2022

**Today's Progress:**  Got the individual pests rendered as their own pages, but with noobish code that I will need to fix at some point. 
  
**Thoughts:**  Today I made a break through albeit with noobish code and after that I lost track of time while coding. I think I found something I like and want to do more of.

### Day 58: February 08, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Did more work on the react project, but failed to do anything. 
  
**Thoughts:** I don't havea a good enough understadning of props. I missed a basic fundamental.

### Day 59: February 09, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Tried, and failed to render the state data. Worked on a bit of easy stuff for the challenge and to make progress.  
  
**Thoughts:** This is getting disheartening, 2 bad days in a row.

### Day 60: February 10, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I got the props rendered at last. I'm such a chump that it took as long as it did. 
  
**Thoughts:** I am happy with how my React project is shaping up.

### Day 61: February 11, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I worked on a simple, but not easy, CSS challenge. Didn't quite get there. 
  
**Thoughts:** The exercise could easily be done with an extra div or grid, but just with flex is tricky.

### Day 62: February 12, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Finished off the challenge and made it responsive to boot. 
  
**Thoughts:**  I learned a bit about setting fixed height and flex wrap today. By setting up some fixed dimensions, you can controll the layout with less elements.

**Today's Progress:** Did some work on my React project. The basic page set up should be set now, just need to add come functionality and styles.

### Day 64: February 14, 2022

### Day 65: February 15, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I continued trying to make the navbar how I wante, I eventually got the functional, but the I can't use CSS to make it display how I want.  
  
**Thoughts:** I am going around in circles here and precious practice time is being squandered on fiddling with stupid stuff. Chaning direction as of tomorrow.

### Day 66: February 16, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I forked 30 Days of JavaScript by Asabeneh. Practiced string manipulation. 
  
**Thoughts:** The fact that I could't do the harder questions on day 2 of JavaScript indicates that I am not yet sufficiently familiar with it.

### Day 69: February 19, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Added photos to the Fiji Page into a new gallery on a separate page and added another page for a separate gallery. 
  
**Thoughts:** I noticed that my back buttons href="/" go all the way back to my portfolio page! Oops, this is the second time I've encountered an issue like this and it shows that GitHub pages are linked and I need to be careful.

### Day 70: February 20, 2022

**Today's Progress:** In the Fiji page, I fixed the back links, added 2 more photo galleries, added a overlay slide to gallery links, renamed index.html to fiji.html. I also tried to found out why the svgs were not displaying in safari browers but I am still stuck. I can make svgs display on safari in other projects, but not my profile. 
  
**Thoughts:** It's nice to work on and improve stuff I've built.

### Day 71: February 21, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Basic maintenance on portfolio and Fiji. Still can't resolve the svg issue but I found the svgs only fail to display when embedded in the footer. Also practiced JavaScript loops and functions. 
  
**Thoughts:** Not much to think about today, but this JS practice is not a walk in the park although some on the presumably harder ones often come easier that presumably easy ones. This shows gaps about methods I think.

### Day 73: February 23, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Tried to learn about objects in a set short time frame of 60 mins. Didn't learn much except I don't know how to access nested objects. 
  
**Thoughts:** It would be nice if 30 days of JavaScript's examples reflected the questions in Day 8 at least.

**Today's Progress:** Continued object practice, managed to finsih level 2 in 30 days JS Day 8.

**Today's Progress:** I practiced higher order functions forEach, map, filter and reduce in 30 Days of JS Day 9.

### Day 77: February 27, 2022

**Today's Progress:** I tried to make the slide down fluid with pure CSS, didn't get it how I wanted so I'll take today as a lesson in that. 
  
**Thoughts:** Frustrating that I didn't fix it. Can't say I don't try.

**Today's Progress:** Studied and tried jQuery for the first time as a solution to the slider. Also I practiced day 11 in 30 days of Javascript
  
**Thoughts:** This is all well and good, but for the home stretch I'm going to be focuing on results, that is projects for my showcase.

### Day 80: March 2, 2022

**Today's Progress:** Did the desktop layout and finer styling. Now I just need to add the JavaScript. 
  
**Thoughts:** Today was a great day. I was productive. Too bad I didn't quite finish the challenge, although I could have. The webpage is looking good, I may as well polish it and upload to FE Mentor.

**Today's Progress:** Finished the Sunnyside landing page. Put some work into the README.md too so the project is well presented. The live site is looking very close to the design. I also debugged a Twitter friends CSS issue with sticky position. 
  
**Thoughts:** This was a win today, I spent an embarrasingly long time trying to figure out the basic javascript for the dropdown but got it in the end.
