# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 12, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Improved a gh-pages site I have made to practice JS DOM manipulation. 

**Thoughts:** It looks better now but the table is not displaying as I'd like. This problem only became apparent after I pushed the changes to Github.

### Day 2: December 13, 2021 

**Today's Progress**:I wasn't happy with the table in the chem prep chart page so I added some styling. I was planning futher steps to add more chemicals and types of treatments. 

**Thoughts:** The style for input and output is looking better and I'd like to expand this page with more chemicals. However, I think if I do it all in html and javascript it will become unwieldly with too many dom elements to manage. I am learning React right now so maybe I can apply that when I am more comfortable with that.

### Day 3: December 14, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Marginal gains in understanding the basics of React, mostly components and props. 

**Thoughts:** Felt like a grind today, and I will keep grinding until I get it. 

**Link to work:** I am using Treehouse courses on this, React track and mainly this practice https://teamtreehouse.com/library/introducing-the-practice-37

### Day 4: December 15, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: I managed to learn a little bit about React props and rendering. I gained a little more insight into how props work. 

**Thoughts:** Another slow day. I am limited by not yet understanding the fundamentals and syntax of react. The Treehouse coursework on React seems a little dated, the concepts not sticking and the challenges beyond me. 

**Link to work:** Worked on this couse a bit today, final challenge and quiz beyond my abilities for the time being https://teamtreehouse.com/library/react-components

### Day 5: December 16, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Continued my React journey, was hampered by some bad luck getting React to run. Still, some concepts are starting to sink in and a started a basic react to practice things on my own and move away from coding along with tutorials. 

**Thoughts:** Step by step.

### Day 6: December 17, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** I finished another tutorial by Web Dev Simplifed. I had an issue with React not working for a while when I tried to install a package. I installed the latest version of Node.js, unusually the version was too low to create React projects but I was doing it before. Anyway, decided to pivot from React for a bit to work on my profile page. 

**Thoughts:** My profile page is amateurish. I'm going to rebuild it with SCSS and better layout and color scheme. The next few days will focus on that and make it look like I'm serious about a job as a web developer.

### Day 7: December 18, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** I opened up project 4 from the TechDegree that I completed about 2 months ago. This project made use of SASS and made a copy of it and started building a new portfolio page that might actually look job worthy when it's finished. 

**Thoughts:** I do like the SASS as a system for organizing styling of webpages and for a uniform style. 

**Link to work:** Here is project 4, not really today's work but the basis for it. https://github.com/michagodfrey/web-style-guide

### Day 8: December 19, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Worked on the profile page. Had more difficulty with css transitions than I anticipated. I had to put that part aside for now beacuse I  was getting bogged down and didn't make as much progress as time allowed. 

**Thoughts:** It's still frustrating when elements don't behave as you'd like and

### Day 9: December 20, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Another day of slow progress despite dedicating available time before and after work. Marinal progress while I got hung up on the simplest things like elements not positioning as I intend. 

**Thoughts:** It occurred to me to use the responsive layout of project 2 in treehouse to do the projects. Tomorrow morning I know where to start. 

**Link to work:** Home/Web/project4 on my Dell Lattitude, still not worthy of public viewing, but hopefully by tomorrow the general layout will be in place.

### Day 10: December 21, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Made strides today in my understanding of flexbox and background images/images. I am now set to have slick, uniform project displays in a responsive layout. 

**Thoughts:** It's good to feel good about it all again, despite, I admit, a long time spent on what seems fairly trivial. 

**Link to work:** Home/Web/project4 on my Dell Lattitude, still not worthy of public viewing, for real tomorrow I should have something, I hope!.

### Day 11: December 23, 2021 

**Today's Progress:** Implemented an email service with added contact page in the portfolio. 

**Thoughts:** Still slogging through and moving at a snails pace despite at least 5 hours today and 4 yesterday. I feel like the universe is throtlling me and wouldn't have got this far if I wasn't determined. Still just get little things that behave in ways I can work out. Having issues with SVG icons. 

**Link to work:** Home/Web/project4 on my Dell Lattitude, still not worthy of upload.
