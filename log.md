# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 12, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Improved a gh-pages site I have made to practice JS DOM manipulation. 

**Thoughts:** It looks better now but the table is not displaying as I'd like. This problem only became apparent after I pushed the changes to Github.

### Day 2: December 13, 2021 

**Today's Progress**:I wasn't happy with the table in the chem prep chart page so I added some styling. I was planning futher steps to add more chemicals and types of treatments. 

**Thoughts:** The style for input and output is looking better and I'd like to expand this page with more chemicals. However, I think if I do it all in html and javascript it will become unwieldly with too many dom elements to manage. I am learning React right now so maybe I can apply that when I am more comfortable with that.

### Day 3: December 14, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Marginal gains in understanding the basics of React, mostly components and props. 

**Thoughts:** Felt like a grind today, and I will keep grinding until I get it. 

**Link to work:** I am using Treehouse courses on this, React track and mainly this practice https://teamtreehouse.com/library/introducing-the-practice-37

### Day 4: December 15, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: I managed to learn a little bit about React props and rendering. I gained a little more insight into how props work. 

**Thoughts:** Another slow day. I am limited by not yet understanding the fundamentals and syntax of react. The Treehouse coursework on React seems a little dated, the concepts not sticking and the challenges beyond me. 

**Link to work:** Worked on this couse a bit today, final challenge and quiz beyond my abilities for the time being https://teamtreehouse.com/library/react-components
