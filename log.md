# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 12, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Improved a gh-pages site I have made to practice JS DOM manipulation. 

**Thoughts:** It looks better now but the table is not displaying as I'd like. This problem only became apparent after I pushed the changes to Github.

### Day 2: December 13, 2021 

**Today's Progress**:I wasn't happy with the table in the chem prep chart page so I added some styling. I was planning futher steps to add more chemicals and types of treatments. 

**Thoughts:** The style for input and output is looking better and I'd like to expand this page with more chemicals. However, I think if I do it all in html and javascript it will become unwieldly with too many dom elements to manage. I am learning React right now so maybe I can apply that when I am more comfortable with that.
