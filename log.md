# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: December 12, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Improved a gh-pages site I have made to practice JS DOM manipulation. 

**Thoughts:** It looks better now but the table is not displaying as I'd like. This problem only became apparent after I pushed the changes to Github.
